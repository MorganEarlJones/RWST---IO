# RWST and IO
This is a strictly educational project demonstrating an implementation of a minimal IO monad and the RWST monad transformer in Python 3.The IO Implementation is stack-safe by design, but RWST is not(an implentation of fizzbuzz might only work up to several hundred or so)

This repo is meant to be read(comments) as much as it is meant to be run!

## TODO
* More thorough documentation
* RWST example code
